# 🌌 3-Body Problem Simulation

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates the **Three-Body Problem**, a complex orbital mechanics challenge in which three celestial bodies interact under Newton's laws of motion and gravity. The system is **non-deterministic**, meaning small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes!

## ⚙️ How It Works (Real-Time Functionality)
1. **Physics Model**: Uses Newton's second law and gravitational equations to compute the acceleration of each body.
2. **Numerical Integration**: Solves the differential equations using numerical methods (e.g., Euler or Runge-Kutta).
3. **Visualization**: Plots the paths of the celestial bodies in real time, showing their chaotic motion.
