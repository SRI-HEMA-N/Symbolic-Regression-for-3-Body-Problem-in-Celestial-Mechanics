# 🌌 3-Body Problem Simulation

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates the **Three-Body Problem**, a complex orbital mechanics challenge in which three celestial bodies interact under Newton's laws of motion and gravity. The system is **non-deterministic**, meaning small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes!

## ⚙️ How It Works (Real-Time Functionality)
1. **Physics Model**: Uses Newton's second law and gravitational equations to compute the acceleration of each body.
2. **Numerical Integration**: Solves the differential equations using numerical methods (e.g., Euler or Runge-Kutta).
3. **Visualization**: Plots the paths of the celestial bodies in real time, showing their chaotic motion.


## 🎥 Adding a Video to README
If you have a demo video, you can link it here!



### Method 2: Direct Video File in Repo
If your video is in your repository (e.g., `video.mp4` in the root folder), use:

<video width="600" controls>
  <source src="3_body_simulation.mp4" type="3_body_simulation/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


Enjoy exploring the universe! 🌠
